                                    qrLifetime is a project that was created by a group of students from the University of Applied Sciences in Munich.
                                    The goal of the project is to create a platform that allows users to create and share QR codes that can be used to
                                    store information. The information can be anything from a link to a website to a contact. The QR codes can be
                                    created and shared with other users. The QR codes can also be used to store information that is only accessible
                                    to the user who created the QR code. The QR codes can be created and shared with other users. The QR codes can
